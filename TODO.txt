1) How to make a super global variable that will always be the same and shared through all the instances of all the classes (without the need to assign it). In C it would be a static variable.

2) How to automatically terminate animation once it played all the data

3) Decide on synchronisation methods, real time or not. In any case how to do it.

4) Make the neurone simulation time connected to main simulation time (right now I just input the same valuesâ€¦)

5) #Unfortunately I think all nicer ways of doing a for loop in python have the same performance, list comprehensions etc are all good looking for loops. We will need to optimize.


6) Now population matrix can only be square. Will have to do some changes to have other shapes
