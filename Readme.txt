Collection of cell models that we put together so they can do stuff. Hopefully murder humans.

The lfi.py is the basic neurone model described in the pdf and also on the website.

The pdf explains what we are delaying with in few pictures and fewer words.
 
The .ai file is just a source of the pdf. 

Here is the unclickable link from the pdf:  http://www.neurdon.com/2011/01/19/neural-modeling-with-python-part-1/

Let’s make some cool shit.

PS. To see the time course of membrane potential in ‘real time’ refer to older versions.
